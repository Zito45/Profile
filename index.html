      <h3>Before Thinkful</h3>
      <p>After graduating from Hillcrest High School, I served a two year mission for <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. For two years I taught the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Filipino people. Once I completed my mission in the Philippines, I came home and began my studies. It was during this time I met the love of my life and we have been together ever since.</p>

      <h3> School and Work </h3>
      <p>I took a leap of faith and decided to study software engineering. I'm attending <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> and I'm expanding my knowledge in writing code and improving my skills as a software engineer. As for my work experience I've worked for a company called Red Touch Media. I worked in multiple areas while working there.</p>

      <p>If your looking for a new software engineer, I'm your man. I'm a hard worker and friendly to my fellow developers. Please reach out to me and lets build some great software!</p>
